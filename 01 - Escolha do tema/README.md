***Brazil Subnational Codebook version 1.0 <br/>01 May 2020***

This document is the codebook for the coding of Brazilian state and municipal government policies, drawing on the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker), [university website](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker)).

For Brazilian subnational units, we coded nine of the OxCGRT indicators organised into two groups:
- [C - containment and closure policies](#containment-and-closure-policies)
- [H - health system policies](#health-system-policies)

All nine indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale that represents the level of strictness of the policy. Eight of the indicators (C1-C7 and H1) also have a flag for whether they are targeted to a specific geographical region (flag=0) or whether they are a "general" policy that is applied across the whole state or city (flag=1).

| C5 | `C5_Close public transport` | Record closing of public transport (including intercity transport)| Ordinal scale | 0 - no measures <br/>1 - recommend closing (or significantly reduce volume/route/means of transport available) <br/>2 - require closing (or prohibit most citizens from using it) <br/>Blank - no data |
| | `C5_Flag` | | Binary flag for geographic scope | 0 - targeted <br/>1 - general <br/>Blank - no data |
| C6 | `C6_Stay at home requirements` | Record orders to "shelter-in-place" and otherwise confine to the home | Ordinal scale | 0 - no measures <br/>1 - recommend not leaving house <br/>2 - require not leaving house with exceptions for daily exercise, grocery shopping, and 'essential' trips <br/>3 - require not leaving house with minimal exceptions (eg allowed to leave once a week, or only one person can leave at a time, etc) <br/>Blank - no data |
